  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive file upload debugging and error handling for the bulk upload feature in AddQuestion.tsx. All four requirements (REQ-54 through REQ-57) appear to be addressed with detailed console logging, try-catch error handling, proper file input configuration, and loading states with visual feedback.",

      "description": "File format validation restricts uploads to CSV and JSON only, explicitly excluding DOCX files",
      "reason": "The code shows 'const validExtensions = [\"csv\", \"json\"];' and error message 'Invalid file format. Please use .csv or .json', but the BuildRequest explicitly mentions supporting CSV, JSON, and DOCX file formats in REQ-54. The constraint also specifies 'Preserve existing CSV, JSON, and DOCX parser utilities without modification'.",
