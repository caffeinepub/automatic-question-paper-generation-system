  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented. REQ-1 is satisfied in Login.tsx where 'Automatic Question Paper Generation System' is displayed as the app name. REQ-2 is addressed in SubjectManager.tsx which now includes Edit and Delete buttons with confirmation dialog and edit dialog. However, the build request specifies that the Edit/Delete functionality should be rendered in QuestionBank.tsx (Subjects tab), and the diff shows the changes are in SubjectManager.tsx — this is acceptable if QuestionBank.tsx uses SubjectManager as its Subjects tab renderer. One concern flagged: Layout.tsx sidebar branding was also updated, which the build request explicitly marks as a non-goal.",

The file summary confirms Layout.tsx was updated to replace 'ExamCraft' branding in the sidebar header and footer copyright text, which is outside the allowed scope.",
