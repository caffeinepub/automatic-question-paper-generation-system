  "summary": "The diff implements visual/format restoration across all major frontend files. REQ-1 (colour theme) and REQ-2 (layout/formatting) appear well-covered with navy-blue CSS custom properties in index.css, Tailwind config with navy/lightblue/sidebar token mappings, and all page/component files using those tokens. REQ-3 (pdfGenerator.ts) is referenced in the file summaries but the actual file content is not shown in the diff, making it impossible to fully verify the PDF format restoration. There is also a mismatch in tailwind.config.js where background and foreground use hsl() wrappers instead of oklch() like all other tokens. Additionally, extra debug/console logging was added to several pages, which is a non-visual change not requested.",
