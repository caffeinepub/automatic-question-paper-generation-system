  "summary": "The diff shows frontend files being modified (reverting various components, pages, hooks, and utilities). However, the backend (main.mo) is entirely absent from the diff, meaning REQ-2 (reverting the backend to Version 13) is not addressed. On the frontend side, the file summaries explicitly describe changes like 'fixed import from useGetPapers to useGetMyPapers', 'removed broken imports for docxParser and docxTemplate', 'replaced flex-shrink-0 with shrink-0', 'added comprehensive logging', etc. These are incremental fixes, not a clean revert to Version 13 state.",

Examples include: removing docxParser/docxTemplate imports described as a targeted fix, replacing flex-shrink-0 with shrink-0 described as a fix, adding comprehensive logging to GeneratePaper and QuestionBank, fixing import from useGetPapers to useGetMyPapers. These descriptions indicate forward-patching, not reverting to Version 13.",
