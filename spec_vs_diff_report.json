  "summary": "Both requirements are implemented. REQ-1 is addressed in backend/main.mo by changing the addSubject guard from admin-only to #user permission (any authenticated user). REQ-2 is addressed in the SubjectManager frontend component, which according to the file summary had its form state and UI updated to remove admin-only restrictions. The project_state.json still shows both as 'pending', but that appears to be a state tracking artifact rather than evidence of missing implementation.",
