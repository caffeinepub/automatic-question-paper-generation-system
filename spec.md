# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the app branding on the Login/welcome page and add edit/delete functionality for subjects in the Question Bank.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Login page to display "Automatic Question Paper Generation System" instead of "Exam Craft" as the app name/branding.
- Add Edit and Delete buttons to each subject entry in the Subjects tab of the Question Bank page.
- Clicking Edit opens a dialog pre-filled with the subject's current name; saving updates the subject.
- Clicking Delete shows a confirmation prompt; confirming removes the subject.
- Subject list refreshes automatically after edit or delete actions.

**User-visible outcome:** The login page now shows the correct app name, and users can edit or delete subjects directly from the Question Bank's Subjects tab.
